Ukraine and Russian War

 I like everyone else in the world can only watch the horrors of war unfold in Ukraine. Peace should always be a option yet it is passed by. Many other nations are afflicted with war as well yet aren't documented 
and left to fend for themselves. Ukraine is being well documented and is being updated regularly. As a result this is going to be a ongoing project updating bi-weekly with new information. I am hoping this wont continue for long.
